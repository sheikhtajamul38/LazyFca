# LazyFca

This project is created as part of the course "Ordered sets in data analysis". It mainly focuses on the implementation of a lazy binary classifier based on Formal Concept Analysis methodologies (FCA). Typically, the classifier's job can be divided into two steps: pattern selection in the training sample (training) and classification. Because only a subset of the information from the training sample is used in the classification, the classification is completed rapidly. The lazy classification approach differs in that the classifier uses the complete training sample without prior training, which takes much longer but can improve classification accuracy. A total of three different methods were used to perform the lazy classification. Later the proposed methods were compared based on the accuracy with different rule based models.
